  ### Multi-Instrumental Music Teacher

  Explore music across genres and instruments with an award-winning musician and songwriter. From classical foundations to modern production, discover your creative voice through personalized instruction.

  > “To me, music is one of the only pure forms of expression where
    someone, who is interested and engaged, can begin to develop a
    passion for learning. One of the most important things to me when it
    comes to teaching is to listen. Tailoring my knowledge to each
    individual’s interests and learning style is paramount to their
    satisfaction and success.
  > 
  > I want my students to enjoy their time with their instrument,
    which means offsetting the mundane technical aspects of music by
    also learning songs and techniques in a way that is practical and
    interesting to them.
  >
  > Being a teacher allows me the freedom to explore each students’
    wants and needs for the best possible learning experience, and
    nothing gives me more satisfaction than showing someone their
    ability and helping them cultivate it.”

  ## About Dave

  Dave is a musician and songwriter fluent in a variety of genres and
  instruments. He teaches Piano, Guitar, Drums, Bass, Ukulele,
  Songwriting, Improvisation, Mixing/Engineering/Recording, Theory, and
  is fully aware of the advantages and intricacies of each of them. Dave
  is a creative soul who finds sharing the process of musical
  exploration a mutual adventure. His musical journey began at the age
  of 3 with his professional training starting a few years later at 7. From there, he has been a core songwriter in award winning
  bands from Guelph (Dancehall Free For All) and London (A-fos and the
  Rude Youth), playing at events such as Hillside Festival, Pop Montreal
  and countless other shows across Ontario. Improvisation is a
  lifestream for him, and he is perpetually absorbing his surroundings
  in order to apply them to his next creative venture.

  Classical music was the starting point for Dave, where he achieved his
  grade 9 Piano and grade 3 theory from the Royal Conservatory of Music, before deciding that other genres
  needed the same kind of attention he had been giving classical music.
  He has attended the University of Western Ontario for Popular Music
  and both Metalworks and Fanshawe College for Audio production and
  engineering, earning a diploma in Music Industry Arts, and a
  postgraduate certificate in Audio Post-Production.
